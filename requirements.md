# 4. CROSS-SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Data Consistency

All database operations must use transactions
Implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates
Maintain referential integrity across all entities
Implement soft deletes for audit trails

- Security Requirements

All API endpoints require authentication (except registration/login)
Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
Input sanitization for all user data
SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
XSS protection with content validation

- Error Handling

Standardized error response format across all APIs
Comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs
User-friendly error messages without sensitive information
Proper HTTP status codes for different error types

- Performance Standards

Database Queries: < 50ms for single record retrieval
API Response Time: 95th percentile under 500ms
Concurrent Users: Support 10,000 active users
