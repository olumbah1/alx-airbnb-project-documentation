User Story (Human-Centered Design):

User stories like this help us stay grounded. They remind us that we're not just building features, we're solving problems for people. A well-written user story is a lens that keeps the team aligned around the user’s needs, ensuring that design and development stay focused on delivering real value.

They also make collaboration easier: designers understand what to prioritize, developers know what behavior to support, and stakeholders can clearly see the “why” behind each decision.
